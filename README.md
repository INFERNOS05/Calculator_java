# Java Console Calculator

## Overview

This Java application is a simple **console-based calculator** that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Square of a number
- Cube of a number
- Square root of a number

The program utilizes a **menu-driven interface** where the user can select an operation by entering a corresponding option. The program is designed to be robust and includes error handling for invalid inputs and mathematical errors.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second with a check for division by zero.
- **Square**: Calculates the square of a number (multiplies the number by itself).
- **Cube**: Calculates the cube of a number (multiplies the number by itself three times).
- **Square Root**: Computes the square root of a number, with a check to prevent negative inputs.
- **Exit**: Allows the user to exit the calculator program.
